# odin-recipes

This is my first official github repo/project?

The current project is making a simple recipes webpage that includes links to other recipes

The skills i will be using are the ones ive only learned such as:
    creating an html boilerplate
    using ordered lists
    inlcuding pictures
    and different terminal commands such as creating directories, files, and manipulating data between them
